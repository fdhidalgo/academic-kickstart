I'm an Associate Professor of [Political Science](https://polisci.mit.edu/) at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu). My research seeks to improve our  understanding of how democracies in low and middle income societies work. My  work has focused the role of horizontal and electoral accountability in promoting good governance, money in politics, and the ways political institutions shape electoral outcomes. Most of my work has drawn on data from  Latin America, especially Brazil.  

At MIT, I teach courses on statistics for the social sciences, elections and representation in the developing world, and Latin American politics. In addition, I am Academic Director of [GOV/LAB](https://mitgovlab.org), a research unit that brings together researchers interested in poltical behavior and government accountability. Outside of MIT, I serve on the steering committee for the Elections, Representation, & Participation Working Group for the Evidence in Governance and Politics Network ([EGAP](http://egap.org)).
