As an outside observer of Brazil, it's hard to be optimistic. Who can pick just one reason? The country is struggling to emerge from a historically [severe](https://money.cnn.com/2017/03/07/news/economy/brazil-gdp-2016/index.html) economic crisis. The president is historically [unpopular](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/17/accused-of-graft-popularity-near-zero-so-why-is-brazils-president-still-in-office), credibly accused of [corruption](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/world/americas/brazil-michel-temer-corruption.html), and lacks democratic legitimacy. The political class has been utterly discredited by the ongoing  *Lava Jato* scandal. A front runner for the upcoming presidential election is a Duterte-like [authoritarian](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/30/631952886/dictatorship-was-a-very-good-period-says-brazil-s-aspiring-president) demogogue. One could go on. 

It's in this depressing context that I made the following plot in the course of some work on the poltiics of drought relief in the most drought prone areas[^semi-arid] of Northeastern Brazil: 
![Infant Mortality in the Semi-Arid Zone in Northeast Brazil](/post/weather-and-infant-mortality-in-northeast-brazil_files/semiarid_infantmort.png)

The plot infant mortality rate by month is calculated from government administrative records.[^infantmort_data]. As the plot makes clear, infant mortality more than halved over the period. To state the obvious, this is an amazing transformation for one of Brazil's poorest regions.[^journeys] 

The starkness of this change led me to revisit @rocha2015water, one of my favorite recent papers in Brazilian development economics. They use rich microdata and finely-grained panel data to demonstrate a tight link between drought and birth outcomes in the Northeast semi-arid zone. In other words, drought systematically led to  infant deaths and other negative health outcomes in this region. It's a great model of how to use administrative panel data to make causal inferences. 

Given the huge decline in infant mortality in the region, I wondered if the relationship they documented using data from 1996 to 2010 still exists. Using the same data sources on infant mortality, but a different[^rain]---though quite similar---source of data on rain, I replicated their analysis using a very similar method.[^replication]. The estimates of the effect of rain on infant mortality in various time periods are presented in the following plot: 
![Estimates of the Effect of Drought on Infant Mortality by Time Period in the Braziian Semi-Arid Zone](/post/weather-and-infant-mortality-in-northeast-brazil_files/drought_infant_mort_ests.png)

When averaging over all years, we replicate what @rocha2015water found: infant health outcomes respond to fluctuations in the weather. But note the fairly extreme heterogeneity by time period: large effects in 1996-2001 and negligible effects in the  later periods.  

The pace of change is evident when I disaggregte the data further. In the plot below, I estimate the drought effect every 2 years:
![Estimates of the Drought Effect](/post/weather-and-infant-mortality-in-northeast-brazil_files/drought_ests_2years.png)
The plot makes clear that there was a real transformation in the human consequences of weather in the late nineties and first half of the 2000s. And this change isn't because of better weather: one of the worst droughts in the region's history just ended this year. I don't precisely know what caused this change, though expanded social programs and economic growth are likely reasons.

So yes, Brazilian democracy is in a bad state. But data like this help me temper the despair that the daily headlines bring.

[^semi-arid]: Technically, the "Semi-Arid" zone, which is a government designation for areas most prone to severe drought. 
[^infantmort_data]: Total births are calculated using the microdata from the Brazilian
National System of Information on Birth Records (Datasus/SINASC). Infant deaths are calculated from microdata provided by the  Brazilian National System of Mortality Records (Datasus/SIM).
[^journeys]: To get a sense of the history of the drought problem and its consequences for human development, I recommend Albert Hirschman's chapter on the region in *Journeys towards Progress*. It's of course out of date, but Hirschman's prose makes it worth it. 
[^rain]: @rocha2015water use precipitation data generated by [Kenji Matsuura and Cort J. Willmott](http://climate.geog.udel.edu/~climate/html_pages/Global2014/README.GlobalTsP2014.html). I use very similar data described in @harris2014updated. 
[^replication]:  Specifically, I estimate the following model: 
  $$H_{iyt}=\alpha+\beta R_{iyt} + \psi_{it} + \lambda_y + \rho T_{iyt} + \epsilon_{iyt}$$
  where $H_{iyt}$ is the infant mortality rate, $R_{iyt}$ is the rainfall variable, $\psi_{it}$ is a fixed effect for the municipality $i$ and calendar month $t$, $\lambda_y$ is a year fixed-effect, $T_{iyt}$ is a linear municipality-specific time trend, and $\epsilon$ is the error term (clustered on municipality). @rocha2015water also control for municipality-specific average temperature.
