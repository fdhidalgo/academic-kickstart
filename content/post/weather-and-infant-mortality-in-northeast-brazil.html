<p>As an outside observer of Brazil, it’s hard to be optimistic. Who can pick just one reason? The country is struggling to emerge from a historically <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2017/03/07/news/economy/brazil-gdp-2016/index.html">severe</a> economic crisis. The president is historically <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/17/accused-of-graft-popularity-near-zero-so-why-is-brazils-president-still-in-office">unpopular</a>, credibly accused of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/world/americas/brazil-michel-temer-corruption.html">corruption</a>, and lacks democratic legitimacy. The political class has been utterly discredited by the ongoing <em>Lava Jato</em> scandal. A front runner for the upcoming presidential election is a Duterte-like <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/07/30/631952886/dictatorship-was-a-very-good-period-says-brazil-s-aspiring-president">authoritarian</a> demogogue. One could go on.</p>
<p>It’s in this depressing context that I made the following plot in the course of some work on the poltiics of drought relief in the most drought prone areas<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> of Northeastern Brazil:
<img src="/post/weather-and-infant-mortality-in-northeast-brazil_files/semiarid_infantmort.png" alt="Infant Mortality in the Semi-Arid Zone in Northeast Brazil" /></p>
<p>The plot infant mortality rate by month is calculated from government administrative records.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. As the plot makes clear, infant mortality more than halved over the period. To state the obvious, this is an amazing transformation for one of Brazil’s poorest regions.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The starkness of this change led me to revisit <span class="citation">Rocha and Soares (2015)</span>, one of my favorite recent papers in Brazilian development economics. They use rich microdata and finely-grained panel data to demonstrate a tight link between drought and birth outcomes in the Northeast semi-arid zone. In other words, drought systematically led to infant deaths and other negative health outcomes in this region. It’s a great model of how to use administrative panel data to make causal inferences.</p>
<p>Given the huge decline in infant mortality in the region, I wondered if the relationship they documented using data from 1996 to 2010 still exists. Using the same data sources on infant mortality, but a different<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>—though quite similar—source of data on rain, I replicated their analysis using a very similar method.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. The estimates of the effect of rain on infant mortality in various time periods are presented in the following plot:
<img src="/post/weather-and-infant-mortality-in-northeast-brazil_files/drought_infant_mort_ests.png" alt="Estimates of the Effect of Drought on Infant Mortality by Time Period in the Braziian Semi-Arid Zone" /></p>
<p>When averaging over all years, we replicate what <span class="citation">Rocha and Soares (2015)</span> found: infant health outcomes respond to fluctuations in the weather. But note the fairly extreme heterogeneity by time period: large effects in 1996-2001 and negligible effects in the later periods.</p>
<p>The pace of change is evident when I disaggregte the data further. In the plot below, I estimate the drought effect every 2 years:
<img src="/post/weather-and-infant-mortality-in-northeast-brazil_files/drought_ests_2years.png" alt="Estimates of the Drought Effect" />
The plot makes clear that there was a real transformation in the human consequences of weather in the late nineties and first half of the 2000s. And this change isn’t because of better weather: one of the worst droughts in the region’s history just ended this year. I don’t precisely know what caused this change, though expanded social programs and economic growth are likely reasons.</p>
<p>So yes, Brazilian democracy is in a bad state. But data like this help me temper the despair that the daily headlines bring.</p>
